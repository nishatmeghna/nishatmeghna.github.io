  abstract: "Over the last few decades, the global production of building materials has increased. Concrete is one of the highly used construction materials and in recent year different types of concretes are prevailing. Fly ash blended concrete with galvanized iron (GI) fiber is a type of concrete in which the cement can be partially or fully replaced by fly ash. This study investigates the influence of fly ash and GI fiber on the engineering properties of concrete by replacing different percentages of cement (5, 10 and 15 by weight) with fly ash and by adding 0.5% (by volume) GI fiber into the concrete. Workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, stress strain response under axial compression, durability at high temperature are the engineering properties that have been investigated. It was found that concrete up to 15% fly ash and fiber showed better result of compressive strength than concrete without fly ash and fiber. The splitting tensile strength was also found to be highest in concrete with 15% fly ash and 0.5% fiber. The flexural strength of fiber reinforced concrete with fly ash has been examined by loading concrete beams. According to the findings, increasing the percentage of fly ash and adding GI fiber improved flexural strength and changed the stress strain response of fly ash blended concrete with GI fiber from brittle to ductile. The durability test results showed that higher percentages of fly ash decreased the strength reduction between compressive stresses at high temperature (500 °C) and room temperature (25 °C)."

  abstract: "Concrete is the most commonly used material in the world for construction and to produce this large amount of concrete requires production of large quantities of cement which results in degradation of environment releasing harmful gases. One approach for making eco-friendly concrete is to use less cement in concrete, and for that aim, other cementitious materials can be utilized as a partial replacement for cement. This research focuses on the mechanical and durability properties of concrete having limestone powder (LSP) as a partial replacement for cement. Five different combinations are considered for this study and level of LSP replacement is 5%, 10%,15% and 20% (by weight). The result indicates that the slump value increases with increasing LSP content. At 28 days compressive strength and flexural strength are found the highest for a replacement of 10% cement with LSP. The concrete cylinders are subjected to elevated temperature (200°C and 400°C) for one hour and then cooled down to room temperature (25°C). Reduction in compressive strength with increased temperature is up to 6% at 200°C temperature and up to 11% at 400°C temperature. Chloride ion penetrability of LSP concrete is also performed using a surface resistivity meter. Penetrability of chloride ion is reducing with increased LSP content in concrete. Therefore, incorporating 10% LSP in concrete as a replacement of Portland cement will increase the mechanical and durability properties of concrete."

#  abstract: "Artificial Intelligence enabled automated reception to perform as a human receptionist to avoid face-to-face interaction among mass people regarding their daily service in the current pandemic. Inspired by their current problem of mass congestion, our proposed AI-based Smart Reception can authenticate users and interact in Bangla language with humans by responding to university-domain-related queries, resulting in better business service and outcomes. We used OpenFace face recognition for authentication, having an accuracy of 92.92% with 1×10−5 second training time for a new image by saving the image dataset as a collection of an array file. The Interaction Recognition system consists of three modules: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Interactive Agent, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis. We used the OpenSLR- Large Bengali ASR Training Data to train the Deep Speech 2 model for ASR with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 42.15%. We tested our developed database management architecture for the Interaction Recognition system with the three-step evaluation using BERT sentence transformer (paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2) that provided satisfactory responses with 92% accuracy, increasing the receptionist performance significantly. TTS module relays on WavNet gTTS model. Our research also demonstrated that a developed AI-based system could be an adaptive solution for any domain-specific reception system responsible for systematic and efficient customer service offline and online."

#  abstract: "The research study presents an architecture of HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) based Artificial Conversational Entity integrated with speaker recognition ability to avail modern healthcare services. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation has become troublesome for health workers and patients to visit hospitals because of the high risk of virus dissemination. To minimize the mass congestion, our developed architecture would be an appropriate, cost-effective solution that automates the reception system by enabling AI-based HRI and providing fast and advanced healthcare services in the context of Bangladesh. The architecture consists of two significant subsections: Speaker Recognition and Artificial Conversational Entities having Automatic Speech Recognition in Bengali, Interactive Agent, and Text-to-Speech-synthesis. We used MFCC features as the linguistic parameters and the GMM statistical model to adapt each speaker’s voice and estimation and maximization algorithm to identify the speaker’s identity. The developed speaker recognition module performed significantly with 94.38% average accuracy in noisy environments and 96.27% average accuracy in studio quality environments and achieved a word error rate (WER) of 42.15% from RNN based Deep Speech 2 model for Bangla Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Besides, Artificial Conversational Entity performs with an average accuracy of 98.58% in a small-scale real-time environmen."
