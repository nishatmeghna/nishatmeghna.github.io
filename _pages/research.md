  <h4>Expert Goggles</h4>

 This research project introduces the Learner Driven Approach, previously known as Expert Goggles, as a solution to address the challenge of interpreting complex data visualizations online. Not everyone possesses the necessary data literacy skills to effectively understand these visualizations. The approach offers just-in-time guidance to assist non-experts in interpreting web-based visualizations, aiming to transform everyday experiences into informal learning opportunities. The project explores different expert processes for automatically detecting the context and providing timely support. It also involves comparing various methods of delivering just-in-time learning opportunities to students. The Expert Goggles tool is highlighted as a tool that provides interactive guidance and multiple interactions to aid in the interpretation of data visualizations.

  <h4>PiggyBack Learning</h4>

For young children, educational programming is an opportunity to engage with learning concepts in fun and entertaining ways. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission enforces cable providers to reserve X time for educational materials; however, no such restrictions exist on popular platforms like YouTube or TikTok.  . We introduce the concept of “Piggyback Learning” which creates educational materials on top of existing non-educational content.  Our system XXX will extract content such as subtitles and objects of interest from videos to construct comprehension quizzes and other learning activities automatically. Primarily, PBL focuses on extracting different objects, behaviors, words, and basic maths to correlate with real-life context by creating different interactive learning materials.

<h4>Hit the Rabbit Game</h4>
"Hit the Rabbit" was a project I worked on during my undergraduate studies in the Digital Logic Design (DLD) lab. The project involved constructing a game using basic integrated circuits (ICs). The objective of the game was to hit the blinking LED with a switch to earn points. If a player missed or pressed the wrong blinking light, their score would be deducted. To implement the game, we utilized various components such as a random number generator, pulse generator, one-hot decoder, NOR gates, addition blocks, buffer circuit, point subtraction and calculation block, decoder, and seven-segment displays. These components were combined to create the entire system for the game.

  <h4>Bangla Sign Language Detection</h4>

Sign language is the best way of communication for the specialized people who lack the power of hear. Every country has a sign language of its own. Hence, it is not possible for deaf people living in Bangladesh to understand the sign language of other countries. This article represents a method of translating English (British) sign language to Bengali Sign Language using basic digital signal processing and machine learning techniques. In this study MATLAB has been used through every procedures made.
