  <h4>TU Delft</h4>

  At TU Delft, during 2014–1018 I was a member of the 3mE PhD council. Within this position, I co-organised a number of lunch lectures both on the topics related to academia and industry, as well as well-being (for example, a finisher of the 3100 mile running race [Pradeep Hoogakker](https://3100.srichinmoyraces.org/rtl-nieuws-does-story-pradeep-5000-kilometer-rondjes-rennen?page=2) gave a talk on the importance of mental health). During my PhD, I was also a member of the Research Council of [HFAuto](http://hf-auto.eu), where I served as a link between early-stage researchers and managers of the project. To contribute to academic mobility and career development of academics in the EU, I became a member of the advisory board of the EURAXESS project [TOP IV](https://euraxess-top.eu/top-iv/the-basics).

  <h4>Marie Curie Alumni Association (MCAA)</h4>

  To contribute back to the community that allowed me to conduct my PhD research, I became an active volunteer of [Marie Curie Alumni Association (MCAA)](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu). In 2017, I organised a series of 20+ webinars on the topic of connecting the worlds of academia an industry ([playlist with webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70cnOuJjHm8&list=PLVe2q_0uMP9SLqU684fZDJwMFHcH320QU)). I also took part in organisation of a number of sessions at the [General Assembly and Annual Conference](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/2021-conference-home) events of MCAA.

  I was the main organiser of MCAA Bridging Science and Business workshops in [Gdansk](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/posts/polish-chapter-2nd-meeting-and-pc-bsb-wg-joint-event), 2017 (50 people) and [Paris](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/events/mcaa-workshop-driving-solutions-science-business), 2018 (70 people), [Kyiv](https://medium.com/marie-curie-alumni/researchers-meet-innovators-conference-in-kyiv-ukraine-88dc38b5ebe), 2019 (40 people), [Berlin](https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/mcaa-events/researchers-meet-innovators), 2019 (image on the left, 100 people), session [Environmental impact of transportation on Europe](https://www.euroscientist.com/environmental-impact-of-transportation-on-europe-view-of-science-and-industry) at ESOF 2018.

  Currently, I am a vice-chair of the [Bridging Science and Business (BSB) working group]((https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/groups/bridging-science-and-business)) of MCAA. Within this position I am preparing a series of meetings on the topic of funding of academic startups.

  In recognition of my academic output and active participation in the life of the association, in 2018, MCAA awarded me with the Best innovator award.

  <h4>Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA)</h4>

  I am volunteer of the [Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA)](https://www.em-a.eu), of which I was the Director of Research and Innovation (2019–2021). In 2021, I organised a workshop on the topic of research and academic exchange during the pandemic. I coordinated the development of research guidelines for young academics. In view of my active participation in the life of the association, in 2018, EMA awarded me with the Alumni award.

  <h4>Open science</h4>

 As an avid supporter of open science, since 2019, I have been a participant of [Open Cloud for Research Environments (OCRE)](https://www.ocre-project.eu). I was involved in the workshop to discuss the structure of [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://www.eosc.eu). I strongly believe that all anonymised output of all research must be accessibly by the public by default (after all, we are doing science for the people). I publish all my articles in open access. Whenever possible, I keep datasets to all of my publications in open access at the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/authors/Pavlo_Bazilinskyy/9126724) data repository.
