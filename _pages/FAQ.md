  <h4> I love to Travel!!! 🇧🇩 🇧🇹 🇺🇸 🇮🇳 </h4>

I have a deep passion for traveling, and it has become a habit for me to explore various destinations, especially after completing a demanding semester. Usually, I take advantage of weekends to visit nearby places that can be comfortably covered within a day. However, during longer breaks, I make sure to venture far away from my usual surroundings. Throughout my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to visit several incredible locations in Bangladesh such as Rajshahi, Khagrachori, Sylhet, Sundarban, Bandarban, Cox-Bazar, Sainmartin, Sunamgonj, and Rangamati. Additionally, I had the privilege to explore Bhutan (including Tiger Nest, Punakha, Paro, and Thimphu), India (Bhopal, Agra, Delhi, and Kolkata), as well as the United States (Colorado, New York City, Washington D.C., and Texas). 

There are still many more places I aspire to visit, but I don't feel compelled to rush and check off every destination on my list. Instead, I view traveling as a means to unwind and relax after periods of intense work.

  <h4> Sports Freak!!! </h4>
I am an enthusiastic sports lover, and I thoroughly enjoy playing cricket, football, volleyball, ping pong, and billiards. When it comes to football, my preferred position is central midfield. I've had a couple of incidents during my school days where I actually broke a bone while playing football. On the other hand, in cricket, I excel as a fast bowler, capable of delivering some impressive swings. Additionally, I indulge in esports games such as Valorant, PUBG, PES Mobile, and FIFA. If you believe that you possess superior gaming skills, feel free to share an online link where we can compete, and that will confirm whether or not you outperform me in the gaming realm.😛

  <h4> Volunteer!!! </h4>
I actively contribute to various charitable organizations in my village, Adampur, Barura, Cumilla, where more than 200 students are receiving education. Additionally, during my undergraduate studies, I volunteered for the charitable organization ["হাসি ফুটুক এই ঈদে"](https://www.facebook.com/events/1708399679245409) and assisted in donation-related matters for the [মানুষ মানুষের জন্য ফাউন্ডেশন](https://www.facebook.com/mmjfoundation.usa). I firmly believe that those of us who are privileged in our country, and even in the world, have a responsibility to utilize our intellectual capabilities for the betterment of humanity. I encourage everyone to contribute and consider the impoverished individuals who surround us, as this will contribute to creating a more compassionate world. 🌎
