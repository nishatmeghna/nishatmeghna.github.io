  <h4> I love to Travel!!!</h4>

Traveling is the biggest hobby of my life, and I love it even more now that I can share it with my husband. I especially love going to the beaches. There is something special about the sound of the waves, the sand under the feet, and the wide ocean views that really makes me happy. We dream about visiting many places together, like the beautiful city of Venice or the stunning Himalayan mountains. We look forward to many more trips. we hope to travel the world together and experience the diverse cultures and breathtaking landscapes that each new place has to offer.

  <h4> I love gardening!!! </h4>
I really enjoy gardening and have filled my garden with a bunch of different plants. Each one has its own special look and needs, making my garden a lively and colorful place. Some of the plants I have include snake plants with their tall, green leaves, silver stripes that catch the light, and African violets that bloom with beautiful purple flowers. I also grow peppers, which add a pop of color and are great for cooking, and monsteras, which have big, interesting leaves that make them stand out. There are also money plants with their trailing vines that spread greenery everywhere. Hostas fill the shady spots with their broad leaves, and spider plants hang in pots with their leaves arching over the sides, creating a nice layered look. I loveeee taking care of these plants and this is theraputic to me. It is really calming to water them, trim them and watch them to bloom. My garden is not just a hobby, it is a peaceful spot that makes me happy and proud as I watch all my plants grow and thrive.

  <h4> I love Cooking!!! </h4>
Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and it makes me really happy. I love to try making different kinds of food, from Bengali and Indian dishes to French and American recipes. For me, cooking is a way to learn about and connect with different cultures. Every dish has its own story from where it comes from, and when I cook, I feel like I am part of that story. My kitchen is like my creative space where I mix ingredients to make delicious meals. What I love most about cooking is the joy it brings, not just to me but also to my friends and family when we share a meal together. Whether it is something simple or something fancy, cooking is my way to celebrate and enjoy the flavors.
